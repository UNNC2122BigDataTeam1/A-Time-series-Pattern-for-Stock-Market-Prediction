#### 1. Stock Dataset

* For the stock dataset, we only choose one stock which is AAPL in this repository. However, the code is compatible with all stock datasets.
* The stock dataset contains 7 columns - Date, Low, Open, Volume, High, Close and Adjusted Close, and 10411 rows.

#### 2. Covid-19 Dataset

* The covid-19 dataset contains 8 columns Date_reported, Country_code, Country, WHO_region, New_cases, Cumulative_cases, New_deaths and Cumulative_deaths, and 193392 rows.
* In the data processing stage, we used filter function to get the data in the US.

#### 3. Requirements list

[See this file](requirements.txt)

* usage:

  ```shell
  python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

#### 4. Reference to other papers/codes

* [Pattern graph tracking-based stock price prediction using big data](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X17301991)
